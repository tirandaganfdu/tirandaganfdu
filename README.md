I am a voracious learner: I watched many many hours of content every day, and my goal is to continuously improve my skills as a Maker: Microcontrollers (e.g. Raspberry PI), electronics, electrical engineering, Woodworking (I was featured in Fine Woodworking Magazine for one of my signature mid-century-modern furniture pieces), TIG/MIG welding, Plasma Cutting, 3D Resin Printing, CNC and more.

I teach AI at FDU in Teaneck, NJ and live in Union County, New Jersey.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on RAG applications for real world business problems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced features in LangChain, using Cursor.AI, Unstructured.AI and more
